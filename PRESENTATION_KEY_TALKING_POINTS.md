# CyberOps Range - Key Talking Points Reference Card

## The Big Picture
**"This isn't simulation - it's operational training on operational systems"**

---

## üéØ Core Differentiators

### 1. **Hardware-in-the-Loop**
- ‚úÖ Connect REAL PLCs, SCADA, radios, sensors
- ‚úÖ Real equipment = real behaviors = real learning
- ‚úÖ "Train on what you'll defend"

### 2. **Enterprise Integration**
- ‚úÖ YOUR email system (Exchange, Gmail)
- ‚úÖ YOUR authentication (AD, LDAP, SSO)
- ‚úÖ YOUR tools (ServiceNow, Splunk, Teams)
- ‚úÖ YOUR processes and procedures

### 3. **Any Environment**
- ‚úÖ Air-gapped (SECRET/TS ready)
- ‚úÖ Cloud (global reach)
- ‚úÖ On-premise (complete control)
- ‚úÖ Hybrid (best of both)

## üí¨ Power Phrases

### Opening Impact
- "Traditional tabletop exercises don't prepare you for real chaos"
- "You can't learn pressure without experiencing pressure"
- "Train like you fight - on the systems you'll defend"

### Differentiators
- "We don't simulate your email - we integrate with it"
- "Not vendor scenarios - YOUR scenarios, YOUR systems"
- "From classified air-gaps to global cloud - we deploy anywhere"

### Value Statements
- "NATO Locked Shields capability at 1/10th the cost"
- "One platform protects ALL critical infrastructure"
- "Complete ownership - no vendor lock-in"

### Closing Impact
- "When real incidents hit, you've already been there"
- "Same pressure, same systems, same team - different outcome"
- "This is the future of operational readiness"

## üé™ Scenario Examples

### Today: Maritime Port
- AIS manipulation
- CCTV interference  
- Container system attacks
- Multi-stakeholder chaos

### Adaptable To:
- **Power Grid**: SCADA attacks, cascading blackouts
- **Military Base**: Multi-domain operations, force protection
- **Airport**: ATC systems, passenger safety, operations
- **Water System**: SCADA, public safety, contamination
- **Financial**: Trading systems, market manipulation
- **Healthcare**: Medical devices, patient safety, ransomware

## ‚ùì Handling Questions

### "Can it work with our legacy systems?"
*"If it has an interface, we can integrate it. We've connected everything from 1980s SCADA to modern cloud platforms."*

### "What about our security requirements?"
*"Built for air-gapped, classified environments. No internet required, no dependencies, complete functionality offline."*

### "How is this different from [Competitor]?"
*"They simulate. We integrate. You train on YOUR actual systems with YOUR actual processes. That's the difference between theory and readiness."*

### "What's the real ROI?"
*"Beyond the 300% financial ROI, it's about preventing that one incident that could cost millions and reputation. Can you afford NOT to be ready?"*

## üöÄ Call to Action

1. **Immediate**: "Experience today with YOUR systems in mind"
2. **Short-term**: "Let's discuss YOUR critical infrastructure"
3. **Long-term**: "Transform your organization's readiness"

## Remember
You're not selling a maritime exercise. You're demonstrating a **revolutionary training platform** that can protect ANY critical infrastructure by training teams on their ACTUAL operational systems.
