# PORTFALL™
## Maritime Cyber Crisis Simulation Platform

---

### Transform Your Crisis Response Capabilities Through Immersive Training

**PORTFALL** is an advanced cyber crisis simulation platform designed specifically for maritime port operations. Through realistic, scenario-based exercises, your teams develop the muscle memory needed to respond effectively when real incidents strike.

---

## The Challenge

Maritime ports face unprecedented cyber threats:
- **40% increase** in cyber attacks on maritime infrastructure (2023)
- **$3.5M average cost** per port cyber incident
- **72 hours average** recovery time from major incidents
- **Limited opportunities** for realistic crisis training

Traditional tabletop exercises fail to replicate the pressure, complexity, and cross-functional coordination required during real cyber crises.

---

## The PORTFALL Solution

PORTFALL creates a hyper-realistic simulation environment that challenges your entire crisis response ecosystem:

### 🚢 **Maritime-Specific Scenarios**
- AIS signal manipulation and vessel tracking disruption
- Container management system attacks
- Port equipment ransomware
- Supply chain cascade failures
- GPS spoofing and navigation interference

### 👥 **Multi-Team Coordination**
Six distinct team roles working in parallel:
- **Executive Leadership** - Strategic decisions and stakeholder management
- **Legal & Compliance** - Regulatory requirements and breach notifications
- **Technical/Cyber** - System analysis and incident containment
- **Media & Communications** - Public messaging and reputation management
- **Operations** - Business continuity and safety protocols
- **Incident Coordination** - Cross-team orchestration and documentation

### 📊 **Real-Time Pressure**
- Live email communications requiring immediate response
- Simulated media inquiries and social media escalation
- Time-sensitive decision points with cascading consequences
- Authentic system dashboards and monitoring tools
- Compressed 2-hour scenarios covering 48-hour incidents

## Proven Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Ghost Ship"
A sophisticated attack creates phantom vessels in your AIS system while hiding real ships, leading to near-miss collisions and regulatory scrutiny.

### Scenario 2: "Cascade Failure"  
Ransomware in your container management system spreads to partner ports, triggering supply chain chaos and international incident response.

### Scenario 3: "Perfect Storm"
Coordinated attacks on multiple systems during peak operations test your ability to maintain safety while managing media, regulators, and recovery.

### Custom Scenarios
Work with our team to develop scenarios based on your specific systems, threats, and operational environment.
