# System Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Fixed Issues

### WebSocket Client Issues
- Added proper cleanup in `websocketClient.js` with `disconnectWebSocket()` function
- Fixed reconnection logic to prevent connection buildup
- Added error handling for connection failures
- Improved `removeListener` to properly handle cleanup with specific callbacks
- Added connection status tracking with `getConnectionStatus()`

### MQTT Client Issues
- Added callback removal functions for connect, disconnect, and message callbacks
- Implemented proper error handling for disconnected client operations
- Reduced excessive logging in production builds
- Improved connection management with proper cleanup

### Memory Leak Prevention
- Fixed component cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Tracked and cleared timeouts and intervals properly
- Used refs to store and manage intervals, timeouts, and WebSocket connections
- Removed global window object assignments without proper cleanup

### State Management Improvements
- Used refs to avoid race conditions in state updates
- Implemented safer state update patterns with functional updates
- Added explicit error handling for state operations
- Fixed dependency arrays in useEffect hooks

### App.js Improvements
- Completely refactored MQTT connection handling
- Tracked and cleaned up all timeouts and intervals
- Used refs for stable references across renders
- Improved error handling for message processing
- Fixed stale closure issues with proper dependency arrays

### globalState.js Improvements
- Reorganized WebSocket connection and event handling
- Split complex functions into smaller, focused handlers
- Fixed dependency arrays to avoid stale closures
- Added proper cleanup on component unmount
- Used refs to track message processing state

### Components Fixes
- Fixed `Scenario.js` to properly handle timeouts
- Added useCallback for stable function references
- Improved state updates with functional form
- Added proper cleanup for all side effects

### Email Handling Improvements
- Fixed email duplication by tracking processed injects
- Added safer ID generation and comparison
- Improved performance by reducing unnecessary state updates

## Remaining Considerations

### TypeScript Migration
- Consider migrating the codebase to TypeScript for better type safety
- This would prevent many common issues with stale closures and incorrect prop types

### Further Code Organization
- Some components are still handling too many responsibilities
- Consider splitting large components into smaller, focused ones

### Global State Management
- Consider using a more robust state management solution like Redux or Zustand
- This would help centralize state logic and reduce prop drilling

### Performance Improvements
- Memoize expensive calculations with useMemo
- Further optimize renders with React.memo for components
- Reduce debug logging in production builds

### Testing
- Add comprehensive tests for critical components
- Test edge cases for WebSocket and MQTT connections
- Verify state persistence across page navigation

## Next Steps
1. Run extensive testing on all fixed components
2. Monitor for any memory leaks in long-running sessions
3. Consider implementing the remaining considerations listed above
4. Document the improved architecture for future maintenance
