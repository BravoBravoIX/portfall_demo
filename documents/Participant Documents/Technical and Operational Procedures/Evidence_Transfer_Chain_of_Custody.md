# Evidence Transfer and Chain-of-Custody Procedures

## Document Information
**Document Type:** Forensic Evidence Management Framework 
**Intended Users:** Technical Team, Legal Team, Incident Coordinator 
**Usage Context:** Evidence collection, preservation, and transfer during cyber incidents 
**Related Scenarios:** VM investigations, log analysis, forensic chain-of-custody

---

## Purpose
This document establishes formal procedures for collecting, preserving, transferring, and maintaining chain-of-custody for digital evidence during cybersecurity incidents, ensuring legal admissibility and investigative integrity.

## When to Use These Procedures
- Suspected security breaches requiring evidence preservation
- System anomalies needing forensic investigation
- Preparation for potential legal proceedings
- Regulatory compliance requiring evidence documentation
- Cross-system investigations requiring evidence correlation

---

## Legal Framework and Requirements

### **Chain-of-Custody Definition**
Chain-of-custody is the chronological documentation that records the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of evidence. It establishes:
- **WHO** had possession of evidence
- **WHAT** was done with the evidence
- **WHEN** actions were performed
- **WHERE** evidence was located
- **WHY** evidence was collected/transferred

### **Legal Admissibility Requirements**
For digital evidence to be legally admissible:
- **Authenticity:** Evidence must be shown to be what it purports to be
- **Reliability:** Evidence collection methods must be sound and scientifically accepted
- **Completeness:** Evidence must not be altered or selectively edited
- **Chain-of-Custody:** Continuous documentation of evidence handling

### **Evidence Integrity Protection**
- **Hash Verification:** SHA256 hashes generated before and after each transfer
- **Write Protection:** Evidence stored in read-only format when possible
- **Access Logging:** All access to evidence documented with timestamps
- **Storage Security:** Evidence stored in secure, access-controlled environment

---

## Evidence Collection Standards

### **Digital Evidence Categories**

#### **PRIMARY EVIDENCE** (Direct incident artifacts)
- **System Logs:** Authentication, system, application, and security logs
- **Configuration Files:** System configurations at time of incident
- **Memory Dumps:** System memory snapshots (if captured)
- **Network Captures:** Network traffic logs and packet captures
- **File System Artifacts:** Suspicious files, scripts, or modified system files

#### **SECONDARY EVIDENCE** (Supporting documentation)
- **Screenshots:** Visual evidence of system states or anomalies
- **Documentation:** Investigation notes, timelines, and analysis
- **Communication Records:** Internal communications about incident
- **Procedure Records:** Documentation of investigation steps taken

#### **METADATA EVIDENCE** (Evidence about evidence)
- **Hash Values:** Cryptographic hashes of all evidence files
- **Timestamps:** Collection, modification, and access times
- **File Attributes:** Permissions, ownership, and size information
- **Collection Methods:** Tools and procedures used for evidence collection

### **Evidence Collection Procedures**

#### **Phase 1: Evidence Identification (0-10 minutes)**
```bash
# Document system state immediately
cat > /tmp/evidence_collection_start_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt <<EOF
EVIDENCE COLLECTION INITIATED
Date/Time: $(date)
Collector: $(whoami)
System: $(hostname)
Incident ID: [INCIDENT_ID]

INITIAL SYSTEM STATE:
Uptime: $(uptime)
Current Users: $(who)
Running Processes: $(ps aux | wc -l) processes
Disk Usage: $(df -h / | tail -1)
Network Connections: $(netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l) active

EVIDENCE TARGETS IDENTIFIED:
- Log files requiring preservation
- Configuration files of interest
- Suspicious files or scripts
- System state information
EOF
```

#### **Phase 2: Evidence Preservation (10-30 minutes)**
```bash
# Create evidence collection directory structure
mkdir -p /tmp/evidence_collection_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)/{logs,configs,artifacts,hashes,metadata}
EVIDENCE_DIR="/tmp/evidence_collection_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"

# Preserve logs with hash generation
for logfile in /var/log/auth.log /var/log/syslog /var/log/kern.log; do
 if [ -f "$logfile" ]; then
   # Generate hash before copying
   sha256sum "$logfile" >> "$EVIDENCE_DIR/hashes/pre_collection_hashes.txt"
   
   # Copy with timestamp preservation
   cp -p "$logfile" "$EVIDENCE_DIR/logs/$(basename $logfile)_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
   
   # Generate hash after copying
   sha256sum "$EVIDENCE_DIR/logs/$(basename $logfile)_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)" >> "$EVIDENCE_DIR/hashes/post_collection_hashes.txt"
   
   # Document collection
   echo "$(date): Collected $logfile" >> "$EVIDENCE_DIR/metadata/collection_log.txt"
 fi
done
```

#### **Phase 3: Evidence Documentation (30-45 minutes)**
```bash
# Create comprehensive evidence manifest
cat > "$EVIDENCE_DIR/EVIDENCE_MANIFEST.txt" <<EOF

## Legal Compliance Requirements

### **Regulatory Evidence Standards**

#### **Evidence Retention Requirements**
- **Cybersecurity Incidents:** Minimum 7 years retention
- **Financial Impact:** Extended retention per regulatory requirements
- **Legal Proceedings:** Litigation hold until case resolution
- **Insurance Claims:** Retention until claim resolution + 2 years

#### **Evidence Disclosure Obligations**
```bash
# Prepare evidence for legal disclosure
prepare_legal_disclosure() {
 local case_number="$1"
 local requesting_party="$2"
 
 mkdir -p "/incident/legal_disclosure/$case_number"
 
 # Create disclosure package with proper legal formatting
 cat > "/incident/legal_disclosure/$case_number/DISCLOSURE_PACKAGE.txt" <<EOF

```

### **Privacy and Privilege Protection**

#### **Evidence Sanitization Procedures**

# Remove privileged or private information before disclosure
sanitize_evidence() {
 local input_file="$1"
 local output_file="$2"
 
 # Remove attorney-client privileged communications
 grep -v -i "attorney\|lawyer\|counsel\|privileged" "$input_file" > "$output_file.temp1"
 
 # Remove personal identifying information (basic pattern matching)
 sed -E 's/[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}/[SSN_REDACTED]/g' "$output_file.temp1" > "$output_file.temp2"
 sed -E 's/[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}/[EMAIL_REDACTED]/g' "$output_file.temp2" > "$output_file"
 
 # Document sanitization
 echo "$(date): Sanitized $input_file -> $output_file" >> "/incident/audit/sanitization_log.txt"
 
 # Clean up temporary files
 rm "$output_file.temp1" "$output_file.temp2"
 
 # Generate hash of sanitized file
 sha256sum "$output_file" > "$output_file.hash"
}
```

## Quality Assurance and Validation

### **Evidence Collection Validation Checklist**

#### **Pre-Transfer Validation**
- [ ] **Hash Generation:** SHA256 hash generated for all evidence files
- [ ] **Timestamp Verification:** File timestamps preserved and documented
- [ ] **Completeness Check:** All relevant evidence identified and collected
- [ ] **Chain-of-Custody:** Initial custody record completed
- [ ] **Legal Review:** Evidence collection methods legally sound

#### **Transfer Validation**
- [ ] **Secure Transfer:** Evidence transferred using secure, authenticated method
- [ ] **Integrity Verification:** Hash verification completed post-transfer
- [ ] **Receipt Confirmation:** Transfer receipt confirmed by receiving party
- [ ] **Documentation Update:** Chain-of-custody updated with transfer details
- [ ] **Access Control:** Evidence secured with appropriate access controls

#### **Post-Transfer Validation**
- [ ] **Storage Security:** Evidence stored in secure, controlled environment
- [ ] **Access Logging:** All evidence access properly logged
- [ ] **Periodic Verification:** Regular integrity checks scheduled
- [ ] **Retention Compliance:** Evidence retention schedule established
- [ ] **Disposal Planning:** Secure disposal procedures planned for end-of-retention

### **Common Evidence Handling Errors to Avoid**

#### **CRITICAL ERRORS:**
- **No Hash Generation:** Failing to generate cryptographic hashes
- **Chain-of-Custody Gaps:** Missing or incomplete custody documentation
- **Integrity Compromise:** Evidence modified after collection
- **Insecure Transfer:** Evidence transferred without encryption or verification
- **Access Control Failure:** Unauthorized access to evidence

#### **BEST PRACTICES:**
- **Immediate Hashing:** Generate hashes before any analysis or transfer
- **Continuous Documentation:** Document every action taken with evidence
- **Secure Storage:** Use encrypted, access-controlled storage systems
- **Regular Verification:** Perform periodic integrity checks
- **Legal Consultation:** Involve legal team in evidence handling decisions
