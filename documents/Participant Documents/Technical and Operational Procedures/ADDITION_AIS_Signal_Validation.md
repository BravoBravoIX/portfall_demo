## AIS Signal Validation and Correlation Procedures

### Purpose
This procedure provides real-time validation steps for AIS signal integrity and correlation with other system anomalies. Use when vessels disappear from displays, position data appears incorrect, or timing correlates with other system issues.

### When to Use
- Individual vessels missing from AIS display
- Multiple vessels simultaneously disappearing
- Position jumps or erratic vessel tracking
- AIS anomalies coinciding with network or CCTV issues
- Reports of vessels being visible but not on AIS

### AIS Signal Validation Steps

#### Phase 1: Immediate Verification (First 3 minutes)
1. **Visual Confirmation**
   - [ ] Check physical vessel presence through CCTV (if available)
   - [ ] Coordinate with dock personnel for visual verification
   - [ ] Confirm vessel should be in reported location

2. **System Status Check**
   - [ ] Verify AIS receiver operational status
   - [ ] Check antenna connections and power
   - [ ] Review recent AIS system configuration changes

3. **Signal Strength Analysis**
   - [ ] Check signal strength indicators for affected area
   - [ ] Compare with baseline signal levels
   - [ ] Note any interference patterns

#### Phase 2: Cross-System Correlation (Next 5 minutes)
1. **Network Correlation**
   - [ ] Compare AIS anomaly timing with network issues
   - [ ] Check if packet routing delays affect AIS data processing
   - [ ] Review network traffic for AIS data streams

2. **CCTV Correlation**
   - [ ] Compare AIS vessel positions with CCTV visual confirmation
   - [ ] Check if CCTV blackouts coincide with AIS losses
   - [ ] Verify independent visual tracking capability

3. **Operational Correlation**
   - [ ] Check if missing vessels are actively loading/unloading
   - [ ] Verify vessel scheduling matches AIS displays
   - [ ] Confirm harbor pilot communications with "missing" vessels

#### Phase 3: Pattern Analysis (Next 7 minutes)
1. **Single vs. Multiple Vessel Analysis**
   - **Single vessel missing:** Likely equipment issue on vessel
   - **Multiple vessels missing:** Likely shore-side AIS system issue
   - **All vessels missing:** Likely AIS receiver or network failure

2. **Geographic Pattern Analysis**
   - [ ] Map affected area boundaries
   - [ ] Check if pattern suggests directional antenna issues
   - [ ] Verify if specific berths or anchorage areas affected

3. **Temporal Pattern Analysis**
   - [ ] Note exact timing of signal loss
   - [ ] Check for periodic or intermittent patterns
   - [ ] Correlate with other system event timestamps

### Cross-System Correlation Matrix

#### Network + AIS Anomalies = HIGH PRIORITY
- **Indicators:** Packet delays AND vessel tracking issues
- **Action:** Immediate technical team coordination
- **Escalation:** Consider external interference possibility

#### CCTV + AIS Anomalies = OPERATIONAL RISK
- **Indicators:** Camera blackout AND vessel position loss
- **Action:** Manual operations protocols
- **Escalation:** Safety assessment required

#### Network + CCTV + AIS = POTENTIAL CYBER EVENT
- **Indicators:** Multiple systems affected simultaneously
- **Action:** Cyber team escalation
- **Escalation:** Executive notification required

### Real-Time Validation Procedures

#### For Missing Individual Vessels
1. **Radio Contact:** Attempt direct VHF contact with vessel
2. **Harbor Pilot:** Confirm vessel position through pilot services
3. **Visual Verification:** Send personnel to physically locate vessel
4. **AIS Transponder:** Request vessel to reset AIS equipment

#### For Multiple Missing Vessels
1. **System Restart:** Consider AIS receiver restart if safe to do so
2. **Backup Systems:** Switch to backup AIS receiver if available
3. **Alternative Tracking:** Use radar or CCTV for vessel positions
4. **Harbor Coordination:** Alert harbor master to tracking limitations

#### For All Vessels Missing
1. **Emergency Mode:** Declare AIS system failure
2. **Manual Tracking:** Implement full manual vessel tracking
3. **Safety Protocol:** Increase visual watch and radio monitoring
4. **System Investigation:** Full technical investigation required

### Communication Protocols

#### To Operations Team
- "AIS anomaly confirmed: [number] vessels affected in [area]. Manual tracking [required/not required]. Operations impact: [description]"

#### To Technical Team
- "AIS signal loss correlates with [network/CCTV] issues at [time]. Cross-system investigation recommended. Technical coordination needed."

#### To Harbor Master
- "AIS tracking compromised for [vessels/area]. Implementing [backup procedures]. Request increased radio coordination."

#### To Incident Coordinator
- "AIS Status: [X] vessels tracking normally, [Y] vessels missing. Backup procedures [implemented/not needed]. Safety [maintained/at risk]."

### Decision Matrix: Manual vs. Automated Operations

#### CONTINUE AUTOMATED OPERATIONS IF:
- Less than 20% of vessels affected
- Clear equipment malfunction identified
- Backup tracking methods functional
- No correlation with other system issues

#### SWITCH TO MANUAL TRACKING IF:
- More than 50% of vessels affected
- Multiple system correlation identified
- Safety concerns about vessel positions
- Extended restoration time expected

#### EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS IF:
- All vessels missing from AIS
- Active vessel movements with no tracking
- Safety concerns about vessel collisions
- Unknown vessel positions in active channels

### Escalation Triggers

#### Technical Escalation (Network Team)
- AIS anomalies correlate with network timing
- Signal patterns suggest technical interference
- Cross-system timing indicates common cause

#### Cyber Escalation (Security Team)
- Multiple systems affected simultaneously
- Patterns suggest deliberate interference
- Evidence of external signal manipulation

#### Executive Escalation
- Safety concerns about continued operations
- Extended AIS outage affecting multiple vessels
- Media attention to vessel tracking issues

### Success Criteria
- Accurate determination of AIS system status
- Cross-system correlations identified and documented
- Appropriate backup procedures implemented
- Safety maintained through alternative tracking methods
- Clear communication to all affected teams

- Coordinate with: Manual Override Authorization (if manual tracking needed)
- Reference: Technical Containment Guide (if cyber threat suspected)
- Escalate to: Crisis Communications SOP (if public safety implications)
