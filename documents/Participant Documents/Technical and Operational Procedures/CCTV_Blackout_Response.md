## CCTV Blackout Response SOP

### Purpose
This procedure provides immediate and extended response protocols for CCTV system failures, ensuring continued safe operations during surveillance loss. Use when camera feeds go black, show static, or display frozen images.

### When to Use
- Individual camera blackouts affecting critical zones
- Multiple camera failures across sectors
- Complete CCTV system failure
- Intermittent camera feed disruptions
- CCTV failures coinciding with other system issues

### Immediate Response (First 5 minutes)

#### Step 1: Scope Assessment
1. **Identify Affected Areas**
- [ ] Document specific cameras/zones affected
- [ ] Map coverage gaps for operational areas
- [ ] Identify critical safety zones without coverage

2. **System Status Check**
- [ ] Verify CCTV control room system status
- [ ] Check network connectivity to camera feeds
- [ ] Review recent system configuration changes

3. **Safety Evaluation**
- [ ] Assess crane operations in blind zones
- [ ] Evaluate container movement safety
- [ ] Check personnel working in affected areas

#### Step 2: Immediate Safety Measures (Next 5 minutes)
1. **Personnel Deployment**
- [ ] Station manual spotters at affected critical zones
- [ ] Deploy safety personnel to blind spots
- [ ] Establish radio contact with all spotters

2. **Operations Adjustment**
- [ ] Slow down operations in affected areas
- [ ] Implement buddy system for crane operations
- [ ] Increase communication frequency

3. **Communication Alert**
- [ ] Alert all crane operators to CCTV loss
- [ ] Notify operations team of coverage gaps
- [ ] Establish direct radio protocols

### Short-Term Response (5-30 minutes)

#### Enhanced Manual Procedures
1. **Spotter Network Establishment**
- [ ] Assign dedicated spotters to each blind zone
- [ ] Establish clear radio communication protocols
- [ ] Create backup spotter rotation schedule

2. **Modified Operating Procedures**
- [ ] Reduce crane movement speed in blind zones
- [ ] Require verbal confirmation for all container moves
- [ ] Implement double-check system for safety clearances

3. **Alternative Monitoring**
- [ ] Use handheld radios for constant communication
- [ ] Deploy temporary mobile cameras if available
- [ ] Increase frequency of safety walks

#### Cross-System Impact Assessment
1. **Network Correlation Check**
- [ ] Verify if CCTV loss correlates with network issues
- [ ] Check if other systems affected simultaneously
- [ ] Document timing relationships

2. **AIS Correlation Check**
- [ ] Compare CCTV blackout timing with AIS anomalies
- [ ] Assess if vessels are visible but not tracking
- [ ] Note any cross-system pattern implications

### Extended Response (30+ minutes)

#### Sustained Operations Protocol
1. **Workforce Adjustments**
- [ ] Rotate spotter personnel to prevent fatigue
- [ ] Brief all personnel on modified safety procedures
- [ ] Monitor crew stress and confidence levels

2. **Operational Capacity Assessment**
- [ ] Calculate safe operational capacity without CCTV
- [ ] Determine if operations should be reduced or halted
- [ ] Document capacity limitations for planning

3. **Alternative Solutions**
- [ ] Deploy temporary surveillance equipment
- [ ] Consider external security personnel
- [ ] Evaluate mobile camera options

#### Decision Points for Operations Continuation

##### CONTINUE FULL OPERATIONS IF:
- Adequate manual spotters available
- Clear radio communication maintained
- Crew comfortable with manual procedures
- No correlation with other system failures

##### REDUCE OPERATIONS IF:
- Limited spotter coverage available
- Communication challenges identified
- Crew expressing safety concerns
- Multiple systems affected simultaneously

##### HALT OPERATIONS IF:
- Cannot ensure safe container movements
- Inadequate personnel for manual spotting
- Crew refusing to work without visual confirmation
- Safety risk assessment indicates high danger

### Communication Protocols

#### To Crane Operators
- "CCTV blackout in [zones]. Manual spotters deployed at [locations]. Reduce speed, require verbal clearance for all moves."

#### To Operations Team
- "CCTV system [partially/fully] compromised. Manual procedures implemented. Current capacity: [X]%. Safety [maintained/at risk]."

#### To Technical Team
- "CCTV blackout affects [zones]. Correlates with [network/AIS] issues at [time]. Technical investigation and restoration required urgently."

#### To Incident Coordinator
- "CCTV Status: [description]. Manual procedures: [implemented]. Operations: [continuing/reduced/halted]. Restoration priority: HIGH."

### Safety Risk Assessment Matrix

#### LOW RISK (Continue normal operations)
- Single non-critical camera failure
- Adequate alternative visual coverage
- Clear weather and good visibility
- Minimal personnel in affected area

#### MEDIUM RISK (Enhanced procedures required)
- Multiple camera failures
- Critical zone coverage lost
- Reduced but adequate spotter coverage
- Normal weather conditions

#### HIGH RISK (Consider operations reduction)
- Major system failure affecting multiple critical zones
- Limited spotter availability
- Poor weather affecting visibility
- Heavy operational activity in blind areas

#### CRITICAL RISK (Halt operations)
- Complete CCTV failure with inadequate manual coverage
- Safety concerns raised by operational personnel
- Weather conditions limiting visibility
- Evidence of deliberate system interference

### Technical Coordination Requirements

#### With Network Team
- Coordinate if CCTV loss correlates with network issues
- Share timing information for cross-system analysis
- Prioritise network restoration if CCTV depends on it

#### With Cyber Security (if applicable)
- Escalate if CCTV failure appears deliberate
- Preserve logs if cyber incident suspected
- Coordinate with other system anomaly investigations

### Restoration Verification Process

#### Pre-Restoration Testing
1. **Camera Functionality**
- [ ] Test each camera feed individually
- [ ] Verify image quality and positioning
- [ ] Confirm recording functionality restored

2. **Network Connectivity**
- [ ] Test network stability to camera systems
- [ ] Verify no packet loss or delay issues
- [ ] Confirm backup systems operational

#### Gradual Return to Automated Monitoring
1. **Phased Restoration**
- [ ] Restore most critical cameras first
- [ ] Gradually reduce manual spotter coverage
- [ ] Maintain enhanced communication during transition

2. **Extended Monitoring**
- [ ] Monitor system stability for first hour after restoration
- [ ] Keep backup spotters available
- [ ] Document any recurring issues

### Success Criteria
- Safe operations maintained despite CCTV loss
- Adequate manual monitoring coverage established
- Clear communication protocols functioning
- Crew confidence and safety maintained
- Smooth transition back to CCTV monitoring
