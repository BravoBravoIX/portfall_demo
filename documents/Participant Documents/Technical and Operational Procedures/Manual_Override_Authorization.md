## Manual Override Authorization Process

### Purpose
This procedure establishes clear authorisation workflow for manual overrides during system failures, ensuring safety while maintaining operational continuity. Use when automated systems are unreliable or compromised.

### When to Use
- CCTV blackout affecting crane operations
- AIS signal loss requiring manual navigation
- Automated crane synchronisation failures
- System anomalies creating unsafe conditions
- Crew refusing to work with automated systems

### Authorisation Levels

#### LEVEL 1: Immediate Safety Override (No approval required)
- Imminent danger to personnel
- Equipment malfunction creating immediate hazard
- Environmental emergency requiring immediate response

#### LEVEL 2: Operational Override (Supervisor approval)
- CCTV blackout affecting single crane
- Minor AIS discrepancies
- Single-system automation failure
- Crew comfort/confidence issues

#### LEVEL 3: Multi-System Override (Operations Manager approval)
- Multiple crane manual operation
- AIS system-wide manual operation
- Berth shutdown for safety
- Extended manual operations (>2 hours)

#### LEVEL 4: Terminal Override (Executive approval)
- Terminal-wide automation shutdown
- Multi-berth operations halt
- Extended operations suspension
- Media/regulatory visibility operations

### Authorisation Workflow

#### Step 1: Situation Assessment (2 minutes)
1. **Safety Evaluation**
 - [ ] Immediate danger present? - LEVEL 1 (proceed immediately)
 - [ ] Equipment functioning but crew uncomfortable? - LEVEL 2
 - [ ] Multiple systems affected? - LEVEL 3
 - [ ] Terminal-wide impact? - LEVEL 4

2. **Impact Assessment**
 - [ ] Document specific systems requiring manual override
 - [ ] Estimate operational capacity under manual mode
 - [ ] Calculate expected timeline for resolution

#### Step 2: Authorisation Request
**For Level 2-4:** Use standard authorisation format:

**TO:** [Supervisor/Operations Manager/Executive] 
**SUBJECT:** Manual Override Authorisation Request - [System] 
**PRIORITY:** [URGENT/HIGH/MEDIUM]

**SITUATION:** [Brief description of technical issue] 
**SAFETY IMPACT:** [Risk if continuing automated vs. manual] 
**OPERATIONAL IMPACT:** [Capacity reduction, timeline effects] 
**RECOMMENDED ACTION:** [Specific override request] 
**DURATION:** [Expected time in manual mode] 
**APPROVAL REQUESTED BY:** [Deadline for decision]

#### Step 3: Implementation Verification
1. **Pre-Override Checklist**
 - [ ] Authorisation received and documented
 - [ ] Crew briefed on manual procedures
 - [ ] Safety equipment verified operational
 - [ ] Communication channels confirmed working

2. **Override Activation**
 - [ ] Systems switched to manual mode
 - [ ] Automated safety systems remain active where possible
 - [ ] Manual operation commenced with continuous monitoring

3. **Status Communication**
 - [ ] Technical Team: "Manual override implemented for [system]. Estimated duration: [time]"
 - [ ] Incident Coordinator: "Operations status: Manual mode - [capacity]% capacity"
 - [ ] Executive (Level 3-4): "Manual operations authorised - safety verified"

### Special Circumstances

#### CCTV Blackout Response
- **Immediate:** Station manual spotters at affected zones
- **Short-term:** Implement buddy system for crane operations
- **Extended:** Consider operations suspension if safety compromised

#### AIS Signal Loss
- **Immediate:** Switch to radar/visual navigation
- **Short-term:** Coordinate with harbour master for traffic management
- **Extended:** Reduce vessel movement to essential only

#### Crew Safety Concerns
- **Listen:** Take crew concerns seriously - they know equipment best
- **Assess:** Evaluate technical safety vs. crew confidence
- **Decide:** Err on side of caution if crew expertise suggests risk

### Quality Assurance During Manual Operations

#### Continuous Monitoring Requirements
- [ ] Double-check all manual operations
- [ ] Maintain communication every 15 minutes
- [ ] Document all decisions and actions
- [ ] Watch for crew fatigue or stress

#### Safety Verification Steps
- [ ] Verify each manual action before execution
- [ ] Maintain clear communication channels
- [ ] Have abort procedures ready
- [ ] Monitor crew stress and competence levels

### Communication Templates

#### To Technical Team:
"Manual override authorised for [system]. Please prioritise [system] restoration. Operations continuing at [X]% capacity."

#### To Executive Team:
"Manual operations implemented safely. Impact: [description]. Restoration timeline: [estimate]. Continuous monitoring in place."

#### To All Teams:
"OPERATIONS UPDATE: [System] in manual mode. Safety verified. Expected capacity: [X]%. Updates every 30 minutes."

### Return to Automated Operations

#### Pre-Restoration Checklist
- [ ] Technical issue resolved and verified
- [ ] Systems tested in non-operational mode
- [ ] Crew briefed on return to automation
- [ ] Manual override authorisation formally closed

#### Restoration Process
1. **Gradual Transition:** Return one system at a time where possible
2. **Verification:** Confirm each system functioning before full automation
3. **Monitoring:** Increased monitoring for first 30 minutes after restoration
4. **Documentation:** Record lessons learned and process improvements

### Success Criteria
- Manual operations implemented safely without delay
- Clear authorisation trail documented
- Operational capacity maintained at acceptable level
- Crew confidence and safety maintained
- Smooth transition back to automated operations
