# Multi-System Failure Coordination Guide

## Document Information
**Document Type:** Technical Coordination Framework  
**Intended Users:** Technical Team, Operations Team, Incident Coordinators  
**Usage Context:** When multiple operational systems fail simultaneously  
**Related Scenarios:** Network + AIS + CCTV failures, coordinated system impacts

---

## Purpose
This guide provides coordination framework for incidents affecting multiple operational systems simultaneously, ensuring systematic response prioritization and effective cross-team coordination when normal escalation paths are overwhelmed.

## When to Use This Guide
- Three or more operational systems affected simultaneously
- System failures that appear coordinated or related
- Cascading failures affecting dependent systems
- Resource conflicts between multiple system restoration efforts
- Cross-system impacts requiring integrated response

---

## Multi-System Failure Classification

### Type A: Cascading Failures
**Characteristics:**
- One system failure causes others to fail
- Clear dependency relationships
- Predictable failure sequence
- Single root cause

**Examples:**
- Network failure → AIS data loss → Manual operations → CCTV reliance
- Power failure → Multiple system shutdowns
- Database corruption → Multiple application failures

### Type B: Coordinated Attacks
**Characteristics:**
- Multiple systems targeted simultaneously
- No clear dependency relationship
- Sophisticated attack patterns
- Evidence of deliberate action

**Examples:**
- Network interference + AIS spoofing + CCTV blackout
- Unauthorized access to multiple unrelated systems
- Systematic log deletion across multiple platforms

### Type C: Environmental/External
**Characteristics:**
- External factor affecting multiple systems
- Natural or infrastructure-related cause
- Affects systems sharing common dependencies
- Typically affects physical layer

**Examples:**
- Weather affecting antenna systems
- Utility failures affecting multiple systems
- Vendor outage affecting multiple services

|--------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Emergency Communications | Critical | High | Low | 1 |

   - [ ] Every 30 minutes thereafter
   - [ ] Emergency briefings as required

2. **Decision Authority**
   - [ ] Safety decisions: Operations Coordinator (immediate implementation)
   - [ ] Resource allocation: Technical Coordinator (technical resources)
   - [ ] Strategic decisions: Incident Commander (overall direction)
   - [ ] External communication: Communications Coordinator

3. **Information Flow**
   - [ ] All teams report to coordinators every 15 minutes
   - [ ] Coordinators brief Incident Commander every 30 minutes
   - [ ] Critical updates communicated immediately

### Phase 3: Integrated Response Strategy (30-60 minutes)

#### System Restoration Prioritization
1. **Critical Path Analysis**
   - [ ] Identify systems that enable restoration of other systems
   - [ ] Map dependencies and restoration sequences
   - [ ] Identify parallel vs. sequential restoration opportunities

2. **Resource Allocation Strategy**
   - [ ] **Concentrated Approach:** All resources on highest priority
   - [ ] **Parallel Approach:** Resources split across critical systems
   - [ ] **Hybrid Approach:** Staged resource reallocation

3. **Risk vs. Benefit Assessment**
   - [ ] **Quick Wins:** Low-effort, high-impact restorations
   - [ ] **Foundation Systems:** Systems that enable other restorations
   - [ ] **Safety Critical:** Systems essential for safe operations

#### Integration Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge: Competing Resource Demands**
- **Solution:** Establish clear priority hierarchy
- **Process:** Technical Coordinator allocates based on priority matrix
- **Escalation:** Incident Commander resolves conflicts

**Challenge: Cross-System Dependencies**
- **Solution:** Map dependencies and coordinate restoration sequence
- **Process:** Technical teams provide dependency information
- **Coordination:** Shared timeline with checkpoints

**Challenge: Information Overload**
- **Solution:** Structured reporting with standardized updates
- **Process:** 15-minute status reports using standard format
- **Filtering:** Coordinators filter information for decision makers
