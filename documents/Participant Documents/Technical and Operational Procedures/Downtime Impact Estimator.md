**Technical / Ops Procedures -- Downtime Impact Estimator**

**Purpose:**\
To provide a structured framework for estimating the operational and
business impact of system or service outages during an incident. This
helps inform crisis decisions, stakeholder communication, and post-event
cost review.

**When to Use**

* During an incident with disruption to planning, scheduling, or
physical ops systems\
* Following a failed service restart or manual override\
* Before stakeholder or executive updates involving impact scale

**Step 1: Identify Impacted Systems**

* Tick all that apply and add estimated disruption:

- AIS Feed - ☐ Disruption: \_\_\_ mins

- GPS Service - ☐ Disruption: \_\_\_ mins

- Container Scheduler - ☐ Disruption: \_\_\_ mins

- Crane Feedback Link - ☐ Disruption: \_\_\_ mins

- Berth Planner Tool - ☐ Disruption: \_\_\_ mins

- CCTV/Perimeter Feed - ☐ Disruption: \_\_\_ mins

**Step 2: Estimate Operational Effects**

* Delayed ship arrivals or departures? \_\_\_ ships delayed (ETA impact:
\_\_\_ mins)\
* Containers not moved or misrouted? \_\_\_ total affected\
* Manual crane lifts required? \_\_\_ (estimate)\
* Missed manifest window / customs errors? ☐ Yes ☐ No\
* Unplanned overtime or shift disruption? ☐ Yes ☐ No

**Step 3: Estimate Financial & Business Risk**

* Daily operational throughput loss (if applicable): AU\$
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\
* Downtime period cost multiplier (labour, fuel, port fees): ☐ Mild ☐
Moderate ☐ High\
* Reputational flags:

- Delayed customer shipment

- Missed KPI with shipping partner

- News/media escalation risk

**Step 4: Confidence & Communication Flag**

* Confidence in estimates:

- [ ] Low (very limited visibility)

- [ ] Medium (based on partial logs or Ops feedback)

- [ ] High (corroborated across systems and teams)

* Communication ready for:

- [ ] Executive Brief

- [ ] Legal Hold / Review

- [ ] Public Messaging Draft

**Notes / Additional Context:**\
(Add any specific causes, patterns, or technical constraints that shaped
the estimate.)
