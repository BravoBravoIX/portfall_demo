## Quick Reference Cards - Team Guide
### How to Use These Cards During the Exercise

---

## OVERVIEW

These Quick Reference Cards are designed to guide each team through a 75-minute cybersecurity incident response exercise. Each card provides phase-by-phase guidance without revealing specific scenario details, allowing teams to respond naturally to events as they unfold.

---

## CARD DISTRIBUTION

Each team receives ONE card specific to their role:

- **EXECUTIVE_QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md** - Strategic decisions and stakeholder management
- **MEDIA_QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md** - Crisis communications and public relations
- **LEGAL_QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md** - Compliance, insurance, and regulatory requirements
- **TECHNICAL_QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md** - System investigation and technical response
- **OPERATIONS_QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md** - Operational safety and continuity
- **INCIDENT_COORDINATOR_QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md** - Multi-team coordination

---

## HOW TO USE YOUR CARD

### 1. Initial Setup (Before Exercise)
- Read through your entire card to understand the flow
- Note the four phases and types of decisions you'll face
- Identify the key documents referenced for your role
- Familiarize yourself with decision frameworks provided

### 2. During the Exercise
- Use phase descriptions to understand where you are in the scenario
- Reference the specific sections as events unfold
- Follow the decision frameworks and checklists
- Use the quick reference sections for rapid decisions

### 3. Key Principles
- Cards guide but don't prescribe - make your own decisions
- Not all events mentioned will happen - respond to what you observe
- Times are approximate - focus on event flow not clock watching
- Coordinate with other teams as situations require

---

## PHASE STRUCTURE

All cards follow the same 4-phase structure:

### Phase 1 (0-15 minutes) - Initial Detection
- Early warning signs appear
- Teams assess and prepare
- Initial coordination begins

### Phase 2 (15-35 minutes) - Escalation
- Multiple issues emerge
- Complexity increases
- External pressure builds

### Phase 3 (35-55 minutes) - Crisis Peak
- Maximum pressure point
- Critical decisions required
- Multiple simultaneous challenges

### Phase 4 (55-75 minutes) - Resolution Push
- Final challenges emerge
- Reporting requirements peak
- Long-term decisions needed

---

## DOCUMENT REFERENCES

Each card references specific documents from the Participant Documents folder:

### Document Types:
- **Immediate Use**: For urgent situations (0-5 minutes)
- **Priority Reference**: For key decisions (5-15 minutes)  
- **Detailed Procedures**: For comprehensive guidance
- **Templates**: For documentation and reporting

### Finding Documents:
1. Check your card for document names
2. Use the DOCUMENT_NAVIGATION_GUIDE.md if needed
3. Documents are organised by function:
   - Crisis and Incident Management/
   - Legal and Compliance/
   - Media and Communications/
   - Technical and Operational Procedures/
   - Safety and Emergency Response/

## COORDINATION BETWEEN TEAMS

### Information Flow Pattern:
```
Technical ← → Operations (System status)
    ↓             ↓
Legal ← → Media (Constraints & messaging)
    ↓             ↓
    Executive Team (Decisions)
         ↓
Incident Coordinator (Orchestration)
```

### Key Handoffs:
- **Technical → Operations**: System availability updates
- **Operations → Legal**: Safety and regulatory triggers
- **Legal → Media**: Communication constraints
- **Media → Executive**: External pressure updates
- **All → Incident Coordinator**: Status and needs

---

## DECISION MAKING

### Universal Priority Framework:
1. **Safety** - Always the highest priority
2. **Legal/Regulatory** - Compliance requirements
3. **Operational** - Business continuity
4. **Reputational** - Stakeholder confidence

### When Cards Conflict:
- Safety overrides efficiency
- Legal requirements override preferences
- Team expertise is respected
- Escalate to Executive if needed
- Document decision rationale

---

## COMMON PATTERNS ACROSS ALL CARDS

### Early Warning Signs:
- System anomalies
- Performance degradation  
- Unusual behaviour patterns
- External queries

### Escalation Triggers:
- Multiple system involvement
- Safety concerns
- Regulatory requirements
- Media attention
- Resource conflicts

### Critical Decisions:
- Continue vs halt operations
- Manual vs automated procedures
- Transparency vs protection
- Speed vs accuracy

---

## TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### DO:
- Read relevant phase section when emails arrive
- Use decision frameworks provided
- Coordinate with other teams
- Document key decisions
- Reference detailed procedures when time permits

### DON'T:
- Read ahead to future phases
- Share card details with other teams
- Ignore coordination requirements
- Skip documentation
- Make decisions in isolation
