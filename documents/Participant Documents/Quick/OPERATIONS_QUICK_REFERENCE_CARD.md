## PURPOSE
This card guides Operations Team decisions during the port cybersecurity incident, focusing on maintaining safety, managing manual operations, and coordinating with technical teams without revealing specific scenario details.

---

## PHASE 1 (0-15 Minutes) - Early Warning & Assessment

### INITIAL OPERATIONAL INDICATORS
- **System Delays**: Packet routing affecting manifest systems
- **Visibility Issues**: Ships disappearing from tracking
- **Authentication Problems**: Service systems not responding
- **Performance Degradation**: Processing delays emerging

### IMMEDIATE SAFETY ACTIONS
1. **Verify Safety**: Confirm all active operations are safe
2. **Alert Operators**: Brief all crane/equipment operators
3. **Check Visibility**: Verify CCTV and monitoring systems
4. **Document Status**: Log current operational state

### ESSENTIAL DOCUMENTS
- `Container_Operations_Emergency_Procedures.pdf` - Emergency procedures
- `Manual Ops SOP.pdf` - Manual operation protocols
- `Safety_Risk_Assessment_Template.pdf` - Risk assessment
- `Multi_System_Failure_Coordination_Guide.pdf` - Coordination guide

### OPERATIONAL ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST
- [ ] All crane operations currently safe?
- [ ] CCTV coverage adequate for operations?
- [ ] Communication with all operators established?
- [ ] Manual backup procedures ready?
- [ ] Safety spotters available if needed?

### EARLY DECISION FRAMEWORK
**Continue Normal Operations If:**
- All safety systems functional
- Communication channels clear
- Operators report normal conditions
- Technical confirms isolated issues

**Prepare for Degraded Mode If:**
- Multiple system alerts
- Visibility concerns emerging
- Authentication affecting operations
- Technical investigating broadly

## PHASE 2 (15-35 Minutes) - System Degradation Response

### ESCALATING OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES
- **Scheduler Issues**: Container routing irregularities
- **Multiple Berths**: Loss of visibility on several berths
- **System Reliability**: Automated systems becoming unreliable
- **External Pressure**: Questions about operational status

### CRITICAL OPERATIONAL DECISIONS
1. **Manual Operations**: When to switch from automated?
2. **Capacity Reduction**: What throughput is safe?
3. **Berth Management**: Which berths to prioritise?
4. **Resource Allocation**: Where to deploy spotters?

### KEY DOCUMENTS NEEDED
- `CCTV_Blackout_Response.pdf` - Camera failure procedures
- `Manual_Override_Authorisation.pdf` - Override protocols
- `Downtime Impact Estimator.pdf` - Capacity calculations
- `Workforce_Safety_Communication_Protocol.pdf` - Crew communication

### MANUAL OPERATIONS TRANSITION
**Preparation Phase:**
1. Brief all supervisors on manual procedures
2. Deploy spotters to blind zones
3. Reduce equipment speed to 50%
4. Establish radio check-in protocols

**Implementation Phase:**
1. Disable affected automated systems
2. Implement manual authorisation chains
3. Document all manual overrides
4. Monitor crew stress levels

### SAFETY DECISION MATRIX
```
NO VISIBILITY + AUTOMATED SYSTEMS = HALT OPERATIONS
NO VISIBILITY + MANUAL POSSIBLE = DEPLOY SPOTTERS
PARTIAL VISIBILITY + SYSTEMS OK = CONTINUE CAUTIOUSLY
FULL VISIBILITY + MANUAL MODE = REDUCE CAPACITY
```

## PHASE 3 (35-55 Minutes) - Crisis Operations Mode

### OPERATIONAL CRISIS INDICATORS
- **Container Misrouting**: Specific containers going wrong places
- **Safety Concerns**: Crew expressing safety worries
- **System Failures**: Multiple critical systems affected
- **Regulatory Interest**: Authorities asking questions

### CRITICAL SAFETY DECISIONS
1. **Operations Halt**: Should we stop specific berths?
2. **Crew Safety**: Are teams comfortable continuing?
3. **Manual Sustainability**: Can we maintain this pace?
4. **Recovery Planning**: How to restore normal ops?

### CRITICAL DOCUMENTS
- `Multi_Berth_Emergency_Shutdown_Procedures.pdf` - Shutdown protocols
- `Emergency_Response_Procedures.pdf` - Emergency coordination
- `Resource_Prioritisation_and_Conflict_Resolution_Process.pdf` - Resource allocation
- `Container_Operations_Emergency_Procedures.pdf` - Container safety

### MISROUTED CONTAINER PROTOCOL
1. **Immediate**: Stop further routing to affected areas
2. **Assess**: Determine current container locations
3. **Safety Check**: Ensure no hazardous cargo affected
4. **Redirect**: Manual routing to correct locations
5. **Document**: Full trail for investigation

### WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT
**Crew Confidence Indicators:**
- Questioning safety procedures
- Requesting additional support
- Reporting near-miss incidents
- Expressing fatigue concerns

**Response Actions:**
- Increase supervisor presence
- Implement buddy systems
- Rotate high-stress positions
- Consider operational pause

---

## PHASE 4 (55-75 Minutes) - Sustained Emergency Operations

### FINAL PHASE PRESSURES
- **Extended Duration**: Fatigue becoming factor
- **Night Shift**: Decisions about continuing
- **Media Attention**: Crews aware of external scrutiny
- **Safety Incidents**: Near-misses or system overrides

### END-GAME OPERATIONAL DECISIONS
1. **Night Operations**: Continue, reduce, or halt?
2. **Crew Rotation**: Fresh teams or extend current?
3. **Recovery Mode**: When to attempt restoration?
4. **Communication**: What to tell workforce?

### ESSENTIAL REFERENCES
- `Ops Closure Procedure (Part B).pdf` - Shutdown procedures
- `Ops After-Action Checklist.pdf` - Documentation requirements
- All previous phase documents remain critical

### NIGHT SHIFT DECISION FRAMEWORK
**HALT Night Operations If:**
- Crew fatigue at critical levels
- Multiple systems remain compromised
- Safety incidents have occurred
- Visibility remains impaired

**CONTINUE at Reduced Capacity If:**
- Fresh crews available
- Safety systems partially restored
- Enhanced manual procedures possible
- Executive approves risk

### SUSTAINED OPERATIONS CHECKLIST
- [ ] Crew fitness assessment completed
- [ ] All safety systems status verified
- [ ] Manual procedures sustainable?
- [ ] Resource availability confirmed
- [ ] Communication plan in place
