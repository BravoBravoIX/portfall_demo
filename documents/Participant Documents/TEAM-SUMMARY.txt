## COMPREHENSIVE Team-by-Team Guidance with Facilitator Questions

---

## **CRITICAL FACILITATOR GUIDANCE - WHAT TEAMS CAN ACTUALLY DO**

### **Teams CAN Actually Do:**
‚úÖ **MONITOR:** Use their simulation dashboards, alerts, and interfaces  
‚úÖ **INVESTIGATE:** Technical team can SSH to VMs using provided credentials  
‚úÖ **RESEARCH:** Access all provided documents and reference materials  
‚úÖ **COMMUNICATE:** Coordinate with other teams through facilitators  
‚úÖ **DOCUMENT:** Record decisions, findings, and rationale  

### **Teams CANNOT Actually Do (Discussion & Documentation Only):**
üìù **IMPLEMENT OPERATIONS:** Cannot halt operations, isolate systems, deploy personnel  
üìù **EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS:** Cannot send actual media statements, regulatory notifications  
üìù **FINANCIAL ACTIONS:** Cannot make actual payments, insurance claims, vendor decisions  
üìù **LEGAL ACTIONS:** Cannot send actual legal notifications or make binding determinations  

### **How Decisions Work:**
1. **Teams discuss and decide** based on available information  
2. **Teams document** their decisions and rationale  
3. **Teams communicate** decisions to other teams/facilitators  
4. **Facilitators implement** operational changes in the simulation  
5. **Teams see results** on their dashboards and through new injects  

### **Critical Documentation Requirements:**
Each team must maintain a **Decision Log** documenting:
- **Decision made:** What was decided and when
- **Rationale:** Why this decision was made (evidence, factors considered)
- **Coordination:** Which teams were consulted or informed
- **Implementation:** How the decision should be implemented (for facilitator action)
- **Success criteria:** How to measure if the decision was effective

## **PHASE 4: PEAK CRISIS & RESOLUTION (30-40 minutes) - Time Offset 30-38**

**PHASE SUMMARY:** The crisis reaches its peak as evidence destruction begins (auth logs being deleted), TV crews arrive at the facility, and the CFO blocks all public statements until insurance coverage is definitively clarified. The dock supervisor formally requests to halt night shift operations due to crew safety concerns while InsurePort demands immediate access to all logs. Multiple final deadlines converge: CEO comment for evening news, ministerial submission, and breach notification approval. The incident concludes with coordination of recovery efforts and preparation of comprehensive reporting for regulatory authorities.
