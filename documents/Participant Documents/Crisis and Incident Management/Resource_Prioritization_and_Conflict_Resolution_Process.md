## Resource Allocation Decision Process

### Step 1: Resource Request Assessment (5 minutes)
**Information Required:**
- [ ] **Requesting Team:** Which team needs the resource
- [ ] **Resource Type:** Specific resource being requested
- [ ] **Justification:** Why this resource is needed
- [ ] **Priority Level:** Claimed priority based on framework
- [ ] **Duration:** How long resource will be needed
- [ ] **Impact of Delay:** Consequences if resource not provided
- [ ] **Alternatives:** Other options considered

### Step 2: Competing Claims Analysis (5 minutes)
**When Multiple Teams Request Same Resource:**
- [ ] **Compare Priority Levels:** Apply priority matrix to all requests
- [ ] **Assess Urgency:** Time sensitivity of each request
- [ ] **Evaluate Impact:** Consequences of denying each request
- [ ] **Consider Alternatives:** Whether alternatives exist for any request
- [ ] **Resource Sharing:** Whether resource can be shared or divided

### Step 3: Allocation Decision (5 minutes)
**Decision Process:**
1. **Highest Priority Wins:** Resource goes to highest priority level need
2. **Tie-Breaking Criteria:** When priorities are equal:
   - Safety impact (prefer higher safety impact)
   - Time sensitivity (prefer more urgent needs)
   - Team capability (prefer team with best capability to use resource)
   - Overall incident benefit (prefer use with greatest overall benefit)

**Documentation Required:**
- [ ] Decision made and rationale
- [ ] Alternative arrangements for denied requests
- [ ] Timeline for resource reallocation
- [ ] Follow-up requirements

## Conflict Resolution Procedures

### Level 1: Team Lead Resolution (15 minutes)
**Scope:** Resource conflicts within or between 2 teams  
**Process:**
1. **Direct Negotiation:** Team leads discuss and negotiate solution
2. **Alternative Identification:** Explore workarounds and alternatives
3. **Voluntary Resolution:** Teams agree on resource sharing or priority
4. **Documentation:** Record agreement and implementation plan

**Success Criteria:** Teams reach mutually acceptable solution

### Level 2: Incident Coordinator Arbitration (30 minutes)
**Scope:** Conflicts unresolved at team level or involving 3+ teams  
**Process:**
1. **Information Gathering:** Collect resource needs and justifications from all teams
2. **Priority Assessment:** Apply priority matrix to all requests
3. **Alternative Analysis:** Identify creative solutions and workarounds
4. **Decision Making:** Make binding resource allocation decision
5. **Implementation:** Coordinate resource transfer and utilization

**Decision Factors:**
- Priority level of each need
- Overall incident response benefit
- Resource utilization efficiency
- Timeline and urgency considerations

### Level 3: Executive Escalation (60 minutes)
**Scope:** High-value resources, policy decisions, external resources  
**Process:**
1. **Executive Briefing:** Present resource conflict and recommended solution
2. **Strategic Assessment:** Consider broader organizational implications
3. **Authority Verification:** Confirm decision-making authority
4. **Resource Acquisition:** Authorize additional resources if available
5. **Policy Decision:** Make strategic decisions on resource priorities

**Escalation Triggers:**
- Resource costs exceeding operational authority
- Policy implications for future operations
- External resource acquisition needed
- Legal or regulatory implications
