# Crisis and Incident Management -- Crisis Escalation Tree

**Purpose:**\
To provide a clear escalation pathway for determining when an
operational anomaly becomes a formal organisational crisis requiring
structured response coordination.

## Initial Trigger Points (Any One of These)

Watch for these early indicators. If any apply, initiate Step 1 below:

- Multiple unexplained anomalies across operational or IT systems\
  *(e.g. vessel tracking outage, surveillance feed failure)*

- Expired or invalid contingency or compliance documentation\
  *(e.g. outdated breach plans or contracts referenced by other teams)*

- External visibility begins to emerge\
  *(e.g. social media post, journalist contact, third-party email
  inquiry)*

- Disruption to logistics or safety systems\
  *(e.g. misrouted container traffic, crane or terminal access issues)*

- Formal requirement to engage legal, insurer, regulator, or
  stakeholders

## Escalation Tree

**Step 1: Situation Review**

- Convene a 5-minute check-in with CEO, Legal, Tech, and Ops leads

- Coordinator begins or updates the incident log

- Ask:

  - Is the problem spreading?

  - Are other teams affected?

  - Has anyone outside the organisation become aware?

**Step 2: Escalation Thresholds**

- **Threshold A -- Localised Disruption:**

  - Issue is contained within one or two teams

  - No safety, legal, or reputational impact yet

  - Handled via routine team-level SOPs

  - **Risk level:** Low (Class C)

- **Threshold B -- Internal Disruption with External Risk:**

  - Problem crosses into multiple teams or unclear root cause

  - Visibility increasing outside (e.g. media contact, vendor chain
    implications)

  - Safety, compliance, or continuity concerns surfacing

  - **Action:** Activate limited structured response (lead appointed,
    internal updates)

  - **Risk level:** Moderate (Class B)

- **Threshold C -- Full Crisis:**

  - Operational or legal breach confirmed or escalating rapidly

  - Coordinated, cross-role response now required

  - Reputation and stakeholder trust at risk

  - **Action:** Trigger full Crisis Protocol (see below)

  - **Risk level:** High/Critical (Class A)

## Activation Protocol (Threshold C)

If Threshold C is met:

1.  **Escalation must be authorised by CEO or delegated Crisis Manager**

2.  **Notify all team leads immediately**

3.  **Incident Coordinator launches master incident log and timestamps
    events**

4.  **Appoint official spokesperson** (usually CEO or Media Lead)

5.  **Use Crisis Communications SOP and templates for messaging**

6.  **Begin 30-minute update cadence with leadership / Workshop
    Control**

7.  **Capture artefacts for debrief, legal, insurer, and audit
    purposes**

üîç *Scenario Guidance Example:*\
If ship tracking has failed, multiple teams have flagged issues, and
media has reached out, escalate to Threshold C.

## De-escalation Criteria

- Situation is fully contained and under mitigation

- Public/media exposure is under control or resolved

- Executive team agrees formal crisis mode can end

**Action:** Use the Executive Crisis Wrap Guide to close out

## Notes

- All escalation decisions must be tagged in the log

- Reference Enterprise Risk Register to align classification

- Coordinator should keep running inject timeline linked to thresholds

**Escalation Authority:** CEO or delegated Incident Commander\
**Document Reference:** CIM-01\
**Version:** 1.2\
**Approved by:** Executive Lead, Risk & Compliance
