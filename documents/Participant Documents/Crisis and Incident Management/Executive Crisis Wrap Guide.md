# Crisis and Incident Management -- Executive Crisis Wrap Guide

**Purpose:**\
To support the CEO or Executive Lead in closing out a major incident by
ensuring all decisions, communications, obligations, and records are
finalised. This guide ensures a structured return to normal operations
while maintaining stakeholder trust, legal compliance, and internal
learning.

## When to Use This Guide

Begin using this wrap-up guide when:

- The primary threat or disruption has been mitigated

- All core teams (Legal, Tech, Ops, Media) confirm containment or
resolution

- Stakeholder-facing actions (e.g. insurer notifications, media
responses) have been initiated

- You are within the final 15--30 minutes of the live response phase

## Executive Wrap Checklist

**1. Confirm Closure Conditions**

- Teams report systems stable or successfully contained

- No new injects or escalations in last 10 minutes

- All major actions have been tagged in the incident log

- Legal confirms breach status and reporting obligations

- Media confirms public statements are finalised or held

**2. Lead Cross-Team Wrap Call**

- Invite leads from Legal, Tech, Ops, Media, and Coordinator

- Review:

- What happened?

- What decisions were made?

- Are there any gaps still unresolved?

- Confirm:

- All required reports are submitted

- No further team handoffs are required

**3. Stakeholder Summary Preparation**

**For internal and external stakeholders (e.g. Board, regulators,
partners)**

- Final summary statement prepared and approved

- Language aligned with legal advice

- Insurance policy conditions cited if relevant

- Submission to government or ministerial body prepared if applicable

Reference Tools:

- Breach Disclosure Checklist

- Insurance Communications Template

- Government Report Form (INJ015)

**4. Approve or Defer Final Media Messaging**

- Review draft media statement with Media and Legal

- Confirm alignment with CEO talking points (if interview occurred)

- Decide:

- Issue final statement now

- Hold until full debrief

- Withhold and prepare follow-up instead

**5. Ensure Executive Narrative Is Captured**

- Document executive decisions made under pressure

- Clarify the intent behind any non-standard actions

- Record unresolved dilemmas or constraints (e.g. conflicting
obligations)

- Provide quotes or positioning for the post-incident review

Use the **Briefing Summary Framework** to structure this.

**6. Formally Deactivate Crisis Mode**

- Announce de-escalation to all teams

- Return to normal reporting chains

- Ensure Coordinator finalises the timeline and tags all final injects

## Outputs to Produce

- Executive Summary Document (short briefing note or PDF)

- Final Status Update to Board / Oversight Body

- Closure Email to Staff or Internal Stakeholders

- Entry into Enterprise Risk Register (if applicable)

## Executive Tips

- Balance optimism and realism: state outcomes clearly but acknowledge
ongoing risks

- Reinforce leadership transparency in both internal and external
messaging

- Support a positive tone going into the post-incident review (even if
outcomes were mixed)
