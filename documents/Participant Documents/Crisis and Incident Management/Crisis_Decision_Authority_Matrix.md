## Rapid Decision Process for Time-Critical Situations

### 5-Minute Decision Protocol
**For immediate safety threats or system failures:**

1. **Assessment (1 minute)**
   - Is immediate safety threatened?
   - Is system failure expanding?
   - Are operations at risk?

2. **Authority Check (1 minute)**
   - What authority level is required?
   - Is proper authority available?
   - Can decision be delegated if authority unavailable?

3. **Decision and Implementation (3 minutes)**
   - Make decision based on available authority
   - Implement immediately if safety-critical
   - Document decision and rationale

**Post-Decision Requirements:**
- Notify next authority level within 15 minutes
- Document decision rationale
- Prepare for post-incident review

### Emergency Override Protocol
**When normal authority is unavailable and immediate action required:**

**Authority:** Any team member can invoke for immediate safety threats  
**Process:** Take immediate action, document decision, notify all available authorities immediately  
**Scope:** Limited to immediate safety protection and system preservation  
**Review:** All emergency override decisions reviewed within 24 hours

## Conflict Resolution

### Authority Conflicts
**When multiple authorities claim decision rights:**
1. **Immediate Resolution:** Higher authority level takes precedence
2. **Consultation:** Brief consultation if time permits
3. **Documentation:** Record conflict and resolution for process improvement
4. **Escalation:** Escalate to next level if conflict cannot be resolved

### Resource Conflicts
**When multiple teams need same resources:**
1. **Priority Matrix:** Safety > Operations > Administrative
2. **Incident Coordinator:** Arbitrates based on crisis priorities
3. **Executive Escalation:** If Incident Coordinator cannot resolve
4. **Time-sharing:** If resources can be shared effectively

## Success Criteria
- Clear, unambiguous decision authority for all crisis scenarios
- Rapid decision-making without authority conflicts
