## Multi-System Response Protocols

### Phase 1: Rapid Assessment (0-10 minutes)

#### **RAPID DECISION TREE (Use when under time pressure)**
```
Multiple systems failing?
├─ YES → Are they safety-critical systems?
│   ├─ YES → Can safety be maintained with manual procedures?
│   │   ├─ YES → Continue with enhanced manual operations
│   │   └─ NO → Consider operations halt → Escalate to executive
│   └─ NO → Implement enhanced procedures → Continue investigation
└─ NO → Standard incident response procedures
```
