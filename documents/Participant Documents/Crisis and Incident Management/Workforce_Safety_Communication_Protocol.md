## Safety Communication Hierarchy

### Immediate Safety Communications (0-5 minutes)
**Authority:** Any team member who identifies immediate danger  
**Method:** Radio on emergency channel + physical presence if possible  
**Format:** "SAFETY ALERT - [Location] - [Specific danger] - [Action required]"  
**Response:** All personnel in area acknowledge and take action immediately

### Safety Status Updates (Every 15 minutes during incidents)
**Authority:** Operations Team Lead or Safety Officer  
**Method:** Radio broadcast on all operational channels  
**Format:** "SAFETY UPDATE - [Time] - [Current status] - [Ongoing precautions]"  
**Response:** Team leads acknowledge for their areas

### Safety Decision Communications (As required)
**Authority:** Incident Coordinator or Executive Team  
**Method:** Direct communication to all team leads + written follow-up  
**Format:** "SAFETY DECISION - [Decision] - [Rationale] - [Implementation timeline]"  
**Response:** Team leads confirm understanding and implementation

## Communication Channels for Safety

### Primary Safety Communications
**Emergency Radio Channel:** Dedicated frequency for immediate safety communications
- Reserved for urgent safety alerts only
- All personnel monitor continuously during incidents
- Clear, concise messaging required
- Acknowledge all transmissions immediately

**Team Radio Channels:** Regular operational frequencies
- Safety updates integrated into normal communications
- Team-specific safety instructions
- Coordination of safety measures
- Status reporting on safety implementations

**Physical Communication:** Direct person-to-person
- When radio communications may not be heard
- In high-noise environments
- For complex safety instructions
- During equipment shutdown procedures

### Backup Safety Communications
**Mobile Phones:** When radio systems compromised
- Emergency contact list maintained by all team leads
- Text messaging for non-urgent safety updates
- Conference calls for safety briefings
- Backup to radio communications

**Visual Signals:** When audio communication not possible
- Hand signals for crane operations
- Light signals for area status
- Flag systems for hazard identification
- Written signs for ongoing safety information

**Public Address System:** For facility-wide safety communications
- Emergency announcements
- Evacuation instructions
- All-clear notifications
- Safety briefing broadcasts

## Safety Information Types and Protocols

### Hazard Alerts
**Immediate Hazards (0-2 minutes response required):**
- Moving equipment without visual monitoring
- Electrical hazards from system malfunctions
- Structural concerns from equipment failures
- Weather-related safety threats

**Communication Protocol:**
1. **Alert:** Immediate radio alert on safety channel
2. **Confirmation:** Personnel acknowledge receipt
3. **Action:** Implement protective measures immediately
4. **Follow-up:** Status update within 15 minutes

**Template:** "HAZARD ALERT - [Specific hazard] at [precise location] - [Required action] - Acknowledge receipt"

### Safety Procedure Changes
**Enhanced Safety Measures:**
- Reduced operational speeds
- Additional personnel assignments
- Modified work procedures
- Increased monitoring frequency

**Communication Protocol:**
1. **Notification:** Advance notice when possible (minimum 5 minutes)
2. **Briefing:** Detailed explanation of changes
3. **Confirmation:** Personnel confirm understanding
4. **Implementation:** Coordinated start time
5. **Monitoring:** Ongoing compliance verification

**Template:** "SAFETY PROCEDURE UPDATE - [Change description] - Effective [time] - [Rationale] - Confirm understanding"

### Personnel Accountability
**Personnel Location Tracking:**
- Regular check-ins during reduced visibility
- Buddy system implementation
- Designated safety zones
- Emergency assembly points

**Communication Protocol:**
1. **Check-in:** Every 30 minutes during CCTV blackouts
2. **Location Update:** When moving between areas
3. **Status Report:** Any safety concerns or incidents
4. **Emergency Response:** Immediate notification of personnel issues

**Template:** "PERSONNEL CHECK - [Name/Position] - [Current location] - [Status] - [Next planned location]"
