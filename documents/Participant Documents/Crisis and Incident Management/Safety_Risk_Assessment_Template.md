## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Risk Level Calculation
**Risk Level = Probability Ã— Consequence**

#### Probability Scale (1-5)
1. **Very Low (1)** - Extremely unlikely to occur
2. **Low (2)** - Unlikely but possible
3. **Medium (3)** - Moderate likelihood
4. **High (4)** - Likely to occur
5. **Very High (5)** - Almost certain to occur

#### Consequence Scale (1-5)
1. **Minimal (1)** - No injury, minimal operational impact
2. **Minor (2)** - Minor injury possible, limited operational impact
3. **Moderate (3)** - Serious injury possible, significant operational impact
4. **Major (4)** - Major injury likely, severe operational disruption
5. **Critical (5)** - Fatality possible, complete operational shutdown

#### Risk Matrix
| Probability | Minimal (1) | Minor (2) | Moderate (3) | Major (4) | Critical (5) |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Very High (5) | Medium (5) | High (10) | High (15) | Critical (20) | Critical (25) |
| High (4) | Low (4) | Medium (8) | High (12) | High (16) | Critical (20) |
| Medium (3) | Low (3) | Medium (6) | Medium (9) | High (12) | High (15) |
| Low (2) | Low (2) | Low (4) | Medium (6) | Medium (8) | High (10) |
| Very Low (1) | Low (1) | Low (2) | Low (3) | Low (4) | Medium (5) |

- [ ] **Personnel Factors:** Fatigue, stress, competence

**Specific Safety Concerns:**
1. ________________________________
2. ________________________________
3. ________________________________
4. ________________________________
5. ________________________________

### Step 3: Risk Evaluation for Each Hazard

#### Hazard 1: _________________________________
- **Who could be harmed:** _______________
- **How could harm occur:** _______________
- **Current controls in place:** _______________
- **Probability (1-5):** ___ **Consequence (1-5):** ___ **Risk Score:** ___

#### Hazard 2: _________________________________

## Decision Framework

### Continue Normal Operations (Risk Score 1-6)
**Criteria:**
- All individual risks are Low or Medium
- Existing safety controls are adequate
- Personnel are confident and competent
- No significant environmental factors

**Actions Required:**
- [ ] Brief personnel on current situation
- [ ] Maintain normal safety monitoring
- [ ] Document assessment decision

### Enhanced Safety Procedures (Risk Score 7-12)
**Criteria:**
- Some Medium or High individual risks
- Additional safety measures can reduce risk
- Personnel require additional support
- Environmental factors manageable

**Actions Required:**
- [ ] Implement enhanced safety measures (specify):
  - ________________________________
  - ________________________________
- [ ] Increase monitoring frequency
- [ ] Brief all personnel on enhanced procedures
- [ ] Assign additional safety personnel

### Restricted Operations (Risk Score 13-16)
**Criteria:**
