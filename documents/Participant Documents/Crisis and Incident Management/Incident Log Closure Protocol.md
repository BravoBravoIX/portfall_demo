# Crisis and Incident Management -- Incident Log Closure Protocol

**Purpose:**\
To ensure all incident-related activity is formally logged, tagged, and
closed in a way that supports audit, debrief, legal, and insurer
requirements. This protocol applies to the Incident Coordinator and team
leads as the crisis response winds down.

## Required When:

Use this protocol when:

- The incident is being de-escalated (as confirmed by the Executive or
Crisis Lead)

- The final 15--30 minutes of the response window has been reached

- Final outputs (media, legal, insurer, ops) are being prepared

## Closure Checklist

**1. Final Log Review & Tagging**

- Review full inject list and timeline

- Ensure each inject is tagged with:

- Time received

- Team(s) impacted

- Action(s) taken

- Decision point (if applicable)

- Tag all major actions/decisions with final timestamps

- Highlight unresolved or delayed responses (for scoring)

**2. Cross-Check with Teams**

- Coordinate with Tech, Legal, Ops, Media, and CEO:

- Confirm each has logged their major actions and responses

- Identify any "silent" or undocumented activity

- Capture cross-role communications (e.g. joint decisions, escalations)

**3. Format Log for Export**

- Ensure the master log is readable and structured:

- Sort by timestamp

- Group by phase (e.g. T+0 to T+30)

- Use standard format: \[Timestamp\] \[Team\] \[Action\] \[Outcome\]

- Save as:

- Internal archive version (.xlsx or .csv)

- Briefing version (.pdf for Board, Debrief, and Insurance)

**4. Flag Key Learning Moments**

- Identify entries where:

- Teams took proactive or creative action

- Escalation was delayed or debated

- Policy conflicts or constraints arose

- Role confusion or comms breakdowns occurred

- Tag these for the debrief summary

## Final Log Contents Should Include:

- Inject responses (time, action, outcome)

- Decision records (formal and informal)

- Major communications (internal and external)

- Cross-role handoffs or miscommunications

- System state transitions (e.g. isolation, containment, restore)

## Debrief Use

The final log will be used to:

- Support the internal post-incident review process

- Identify opportunities for improvement in incident detection,
escalation, and response

- Inform legal or regulatory reporting where applicable

- Preserve an evidence trail to support policy and operational reform

## Reminder:

Logs that are incomplete, disorganised, or missing timestamps reduce
learning value and undermine the incident response narrative.
