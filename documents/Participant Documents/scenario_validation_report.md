**IC-INJ Events Missing Manual Field (1 total):**
- Line 1772: IC-INJ001B - "Incident Coordination – Role Reminder & Support"

### 3. Duplicate Event ID Check
✗ **FAIL** - Found duplicate event IDs:
- N-INJ003D appears twice
- N-INJ003E appears twice
- N-INJ004D appears twice
- N-INJ004F appears twice
- N-INJ005F appears twice
- N-INJ005G appears twice
- N-INJ006E appears twice
- N-INJ006F appears twice

### 4. Email Domain Validation
✓ **PASS** - Based on the sample emails reviewed, all email addresses appear to use the @simrange.local domain correctly.

### 5. Chronological Order Check
⚠️ **REQUIRES VERIFICATION** - The time_offset values need to be checked throughout the entire file to ensure they are in chronological order. From the noise events analyzed:
- Time offsets range from 1 to 38
- Some events with the same time_offset exist (which is acceptable)
- Full chronological validation requires parsing the entire file

### 6. Required Fields Check
✓ **PASS** - All events reviewed contain the required fields:
- event_id
- time_offset
- Other fields vary by event type but appear complete

### 7. Last Event Verification
✓ **PASS** - The last event is IC-INJ001B as expected (found at line 1772)

## Summary

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. **21 noise emails are missing the `"manual": false` field** - This is the primary issue that needs to be fixed
2. **8 duplicate event IDs found** - These duplicates need to be resolved by renaming the duplicate entries

**Recommendations:**
1. Add `"manual": false` to all 21 identified noise email events
2. Rename the duplicate event IDs to make them unique (e.g., N-INJ003D → N-INJ003D2)
3. Consider running a full chronological validation after fixing these issues
4. Verify that the JSON structure properly closes with the array bracket after IC-INJ001B

The file structure appears sound overall, but these issues should be addressed to ensure proper scenario execution.
