## **RAPID CRISIS RESPONSE (When Under Immediate Pressure)**

### **IMMEDIATE MEDIA PRESSURE (15-30 minutes to respond)**
**QUICK DECISION MATRIX:**
- **Media calling for immediate comment?** → Use 5-minute holding statement template below
- **Social media posts about incident?** → Monitor and prepare rapid response
