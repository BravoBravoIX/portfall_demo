# Media / Communications -- Media SOP: Final Response

**Purpose:**\
To guide the Media & Communications team through the final stage of
public engagement at the close of an incident. This SOP ensures
consistency, reassurance, and credibility in the organisation's closing
statements and media posture.

## When to Use

- The incident is resolved or contained

- Final technical and operational updates have been approved

- Leadership has authorised end-of-incident messaging

## Final Response Steps

**1. Confirm Closure Authority**

- Has the Incident Lead or CEO formally declared the incident closed?

- Have Legal and Technical teams approved closure language?

- Are all public-facing systems operational or explainable?

**2. Draft Final Statement**

- Reference the original issue clearly but without over-emphasising

- Provide closure timeline (e.g. "Normal operations resumed at 13:40
  AEDT")

- Acknowledge stakeholder patience and internal efforts

- Clarify if further updates will be issued or not

**Example Line:**

"We can confirm that the issue affecting \[X system/service\] has been
resolved. Normal operations resumed at \[time\]. We appreciate the
patience of our customers and the dedication of our team."

**3. Choose Channel(s)**

- Organisation website or newsroom

- Social media (LinkedIn, X/Twitter)

- Direct email to affected partners or stakeholders

- Optional: media outlet follow-up if previous coverage occurred

**4. Internal Wrap Brief**

- Prepare and circulate summary of final messaging to:

  - Executive team

  - Incident Coordinator

  - Legal

  - Technical and Ops leads

**5. Archive Communications**

- Ensure all final statements are stored in the Comms Summary Log

- Capture media coverage or screenshots for internal record

- Tag messaging outputs in the incident archive (for audit and debrief)

## Common Follow-up Topics

                            process."

                            resilience."
