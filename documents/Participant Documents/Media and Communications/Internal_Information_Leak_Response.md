## Internal Information Leak Response Procedures

### Purpose
This procedure provides immediate response protocols when internal documents, communications, or information appear in public forums, media, or unauthorised channels. Use when confidential organisational information is discovered outside authorised channels.

### When to Use
- Internal emails or memos discovered on public forums
- HR documents or communications leaked to media
- Vendor correspondence appearing in unauthorised locations
- Confidential operational information shared externally
- Employee communications leaked to industry forums

### Immediate Response (First 10 minutes)

#### Step 1: Leak Scope Assessment
1. **Information Identification**
   - [ ] Document specific information that was leaked
   - [ ] Identify classification level (confidential, internal, public)
   - [ ] Assess potential damage or sensitivity

2. **Source Analysis**
   - [ ] Identify where leak was discovered (social media, news, forum)
   - [ ] Note time of discovery vs. estimated leak time
   - [ ] Assess distribution scope and audience reach

3. **Authenticity Verification**
   - [ ] Confirm information is genuine organisational content
   - [ ] Check for potential alterations or fabrications
   - [ ] Verify source documents exist in organisational systems

#### Step 2: Immediate Containment
1. **Internal Notifications**
   - [ ] Alert Executive team immediately
   - [ ] Notify Legal team for privilege review
   - [ ] Inform IT Security of potential breach

2. **External Monitoring**
   - [ ] Monitor for additional leaked information
   - [ ] Track social media spread and commentary
   - [ ] Identify media outlets picking up the story

3. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Screenshot or preserve evidence of leak
   - [ ] Document discovery timeline and circumstances
   - [ ] Begin chain of custody for evidence

### Investigation Phase (10-30 minutes)

#### Internal Investigation Coordination
1. **Access Review**
   - [ ] Identify who had access to leaked information
   - [ ] Review recent document sharing or email forwarding
   - [ ] Check system access logs for unusual activity

2. **Communication Chain Analysis**
   - [ ] Trace email distribution lists and recipients
   - [ ] Review meeting attendees who received information
   - [ ] Identify external parties with legitimate access

3. **System Security Check**
   - [ ] Coordinate with IT to check for system compromise
   - [ ] Review email security and external forwarding rules
   - [ ] Assess if leak resulted from cyber incident vs. human error

#### Damage Assessment
1. **Content Analysis**
   - [ ] Assess competitive sensitivity of leaked information
   - [ ] Evaluate legal or regulatory implications
   - [ ] Consider reputational damage potential

2. **Stakeholder Impact**
   - [ ] Identify affected customers, partners, or vendors
   - [ ] Assess impact on ongoing negotiations or relationships
   - [ ] Consider employee morale and trust implications

### Response Strategy Development (20-45 minutes)

#### Response Option Analysis
1. **NO RESPONSE STRATEGY**
   - **When appropriate:** Low-sensitivity information, limited distribution
   - **Risks:** May appear to confirm authenticity
   - **Benefits:** Avoids drawing additional attention

2. **CLARIFICATION STRATEGY**
   - **When appropriate:** Information is taken out of context
   - **Response:** Provide context without confirming specific details
   - **Example:** "Recent reports mischaracterize our normal operational discussions"

3. **CORRECTION STRATEGY**
   - **When appropriate:** Information is inaccurate or misleading
   - **Response:** Correct misinformation while minimising leak confirmation
   - **Example:** "Reports contain inaccuracies about our operational procedures"

4. **ACKNOWLEDGMENT STRATEGY**
   - **When appropriate:** High-profile leak requiring direct response
   - **Response:** Acknowledge situation while emphasizing investigation
   - **Example:** "We are investigating unauthorized disclosure of internal communications"

#### Message Development Framework
1. **Core Messages (Maximum 3 points)**
   - **Primary:** We take information security seriously
   - **Secondary:** We are investigating the source and circumstances
   - **Tertiary:** This does not affect our operational capabilities/commitments

2. **Supporting Messages**
   - Emphasise normal business operations continuing
   - Highlight organisational commitment to transparency where appropriate
   - Reinforce stakeholder relationship commitments
