# Legal / Compliance -- Post-Breach Reform Guidance

**Purpose:**\
To provide structured guidance on how to assess, prioritise, and
implement policy, process, or control improvements following a confirmed
breach or major incident. This document ensures that lessons are
translated into meaningful change and that stakeholders are engaged in
continuous improvement.

## When to Use

- A breach or critical incident has occurred and been formally closed

- The debrief or review phase has commenced

- Legal, risk, or audit stakeholders have requested forward-looking
reform

## Step 1: Conduct Post-Breach Review

- Convene a cross-role debrief involving Legal, Technical, Executive,
Ops, Media, and Incident Coordination

- Review:

- What went wrong and why

- What worked well

- What decisions were constrained by unclear policy or outdated
procedures

- Use outputs from:

- Incident logs

- Final executive summary

- Inject tracking tables or system reports

## Step 2: Identify Reform Areas

Categorise all lessons into the following:

- **Policy Gaps**\
E.g. outdated escalation criteria, missing legal thresholds

- **Process Failures or Bottlenecks**\
E.g. delayed logging, unclear comms approvals

- **Control Weaknesses**\
E.g. lack of alerts, weak detection, poor isolation protocols

- **Training & Awareness**\
E.g. misunderstanding of role responsibilities, lack of scenario
exposure

- **Technology Limitations**\
E.g. inaccessible logs, missing dashboards, system overload

## Step 3: Recommend and Document Reforms

For each item identified:

- Describe the issue

- Recommend a policy, process, or control change

- Assign an owner (legal, tech, executive sponsor, etc.)

- Define a delivery timeframe and accountability checkpoint

- Log in the "Post-Breach Reform Register"

## Step 4: Engage Key Stakeholders

- Present draft reform plan to Executive team

- Engage legal advisers if reforms affect regulatory obligations

- If third-party or insurer pressure is involved, prepare
external-facing summary

- Link any policy reforms to compliance calendar or audit schedule

## Step 5: Monitor Reform Progress

- Track progress of each action via formal register

- Schedule quarterly check-ins until all items resolved or adopted

- Confirm final closure with the Executive and Risk Owner

- Archive reform actions with audit trail

## Outputs:

- Reform Summary Document

- Post-Breach Reform Register (template or system entry)

- Updated Policy Binder (with version control)
