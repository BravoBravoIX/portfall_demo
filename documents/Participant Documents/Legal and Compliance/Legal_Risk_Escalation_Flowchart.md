### When to Use
- Incidents affecting vessels from multiple countries
- Cross-border data breaches or cyber incidents
- International shipping delays or disruptions
- Maritime incidents with international implications
- Regulatory notifications required in multiple jurisdictions

### International Regulatory Framework

#### Primary International Authorities
**Maritime Regulatory Bodies:**
- **IMO (International Maritime Organization):** Global maritime standards
- **Flag State Authorities:** Country where vessel is registered
- **Port State Authorities:** Country where incident occurs
- **Coastal State Authorities:** Countries along shipping routes affected

**Cybersecurity and Data Protection:**
- **GDPR Authorities (EU):** European data protection regulations
- **National Cyber Centers:** Country-specific cyber incident reporting
- **Industry Regulators:** Sector-specific international bodies
- **Law Enforcement:** INTERPOL, national agencies

#### Jurisdiction Determination Matrix

##### Single-Jurisdiction Incidents
**Domestic Incidents:**
- Primary Authority: Local regulatory bodies
- Timeline: Standard domestic notification requirements
- Language: Local language acceptable
- Coordination: Limited international coordination needed

##### Multi-Jurisdiction Incidents
**International Vessel Incidents:**
- Primary Authorities: Flag state + Port state + affected coastal states
- Timeline: Most restrictive timeline applies
- Language: English typically required, local language preferred
- Coordination: Complex multi-authority coordination required

**Cross-Border Data Incidents:**

- **JST (Japan Standard Time):** Major Asian ports and authorities
- **Local Port Time:** Time zone where incident occurs

#### Notification Timing Strategy
**Optimal Notification Windows:**
- **Primary Window:** 08:00-17:00 local time in target jurisdiction
- **Secondary Window:** 06:00-20:00 local time (extended business hours)
- **Emergency Window:** 24/7 for critical safety or security incidents

**Multi-Jurisdiction Timing Coordination:**
1. **Calculate optimal overlap:** Find business hours overlap between jurisdictions
2. **Priority ranking:** Notify most critical jurisdictions first
3. **Cascade notifications:** Systematic notification across time zones
4. **Follow-up scheduling:** Schedule follow-up communications in local business hours
