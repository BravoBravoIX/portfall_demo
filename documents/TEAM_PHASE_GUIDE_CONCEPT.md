# Team Phase Guide Concept - Portfall Scenario

## Problem Statement
2-hour workshop with mixed technical/non-technical participants needs **guided hand-holding** without giving away answers. Teams need enough information to be productive and engaged without being overwhelmed or stuck.

## Proposed Solution: Team Phase Action Guides

### Format: "Team Phase Action Guide" Cards
**One laminated card per team per phase (4 phases √ó 6 teams = 24 cards)**

---

## Sample Guide Format

### **TECHNICAL TEAM - PHASE 1 ACTION GUIDE**
*Keep this card handy during Phase 1 (Minutes 1-15)*

#### **üéØ YOUR PHASE 1 PRIORITIES**
1. **Network Investigation** - Investigate reported routing delays
2. **System Correlation** - Connect network issues to operational impacts  
3. **Technical Communication** - Brief other teams on findings
4. **Escalation Decision** - Determine if cyber team involvement needed

#### **üìß EMAILS YOU'LL RECEIVE**
- Packet routing delays to manifest system
- Packet queue spikes from Node-04
- Password rotation reminders
- Various operational/administrative emails

#### **üîß TOOLS & PROCEDURES TO USE**
- **Node-04 Investigation:** Check network diagnostics, review traffic patterns
- **Cross-System Check:** Correlate network timing with AIS anomalies
- **Documentation:** Use Incident Log to track findings
- **Communication:** Brief Operations team on any isolation risks

#### **‚ùì KEY QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER**
- Is this isolated to our local switch or upstream?
- Do timing patterns suggest external interference?
- What's the operational impact if we isolate Node-04?
- When should we escalate to external cyber specialists?

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è WATCH FOR**
- Correlation between network issues and AIS problems
- Vendor-related communications that might indicate external factors
- Administrative emails that seem oddly timed

#### **ü§ù COORDINATE WITH**
- **Operations:** Before any system isolation
- **Legal:** If external factors suspected
- **Incident Coordinator:** Regular status updates

#### **üìã SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE**
- Clear understanding of network issue scope
- Documented investigation findings
- Informed decision about escalation
- Other teams briefed on technical status

---

### **OPERATIONS TEAM - PHASE 1 ACTION GUIDE**
*Keep this card handy during Phase 1 (Minutes 1-15)*

#### **üéØ YOUR PHASE 1 PRIORITIES**
1. **Maintain Operations** - Keep cargo moving safely despite technical issues
2. **Safety Assessment** - Evaluate risks from CCTV and system problems
3. **Resource Coordination** - Manage crew and equipment effectively
4. **Decision Making** - Determine when manual overrides are needed

#### **üìß EMAILS YOU'LL RECEIVE**
- CCTV blind zone reports
- Coffee machine maintenance (routine)
- Staff policy updates
- Safety and operational status reports

#### **üîß TOOLS & PROCEDURES TO USE**
- **Manual Operations SOP:** Reference for backup procedures
- **Safety Assessment:** Use for CCTV blackout decisions
- **Crew Communication:** Keep teams informed about system status
- **Coordination:** Work with Technical team on system changes

#### **‚ùì KEY QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER**
- Can we operate safely without full CCTV coverage?
- When should we halt operations for safety?
- How do we maintain efficiency with manual overrides?
- What's the crew's stress level and capacity?

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è WATCH FOR**
- Safety implications of technical failures
- Crew concerns about working with degraded systems
- Coordination needs with Technical team actions

#### **ü§ù COORDINATE WITH**
- **Technical:** Before they isolate any systems you depend on
- **Incident Coordinator:** Report operational status changes
- **Executive:** Major operational decisions

#### **üìã SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE**
- Operations continue safely despite technical issues
- Clear safety decisions documented
- Crew informed and confident
- Manual procedures implemented smoothly

## Implementation Strategy

### **Card Design Principles**
1. **Quick Reference:** No more than one side of a laminated card
2. **Action-Oriented:** Focus on what to DO, not just what to know
3. **Context-Specific:** Tailored to that team's actual phase challenges
4. **Guided Discovery:** Questions that lead teams to insights
5. **Cross-Team Awareness:** Clear coordination points

### **Information Hierarchy**
1. **Priorities** (most important)
2. **Expected Inputs** (emails/events they'll see)
3. **Tools Available** (what procedures/documents to use)
4. **Thinking Framework** (questions to guide decisions)
5. **Coordination Points** (who to work with)
6. **Success Criteria** (how to know they're on track)

### **Content Calibration by Audience**
- **Technical Teams:** More technical detail, system-focused
- **Non-Technical Teams:** Process-focused, relationship-oriented
- **Executive Team:** Strategic decisions, delegation, oversight
- **Mixed Teams:** Balanced approach with role differentiation

### **Progressive Complexity**
- **Phase 1:** Single-issue focus, clear procedures
- **Phase 2:** Multi-issue coordination, judgment calls
- **Phase 3:** Complex trade-offs, cross-team integration
- **Phase 4:** Strategic decisions, long-term implications

## Alternative Implementation Options

### **Option A: Digital Dashboard Integration**
- Build phase guides into the UI dashboard
- Context-sensitive help based on current phase
- Real-time updates based on team actions

### **Option B: Facilitator Coaching Cards**
- Give guides to facilitators, not participants
- Facilitators provide hints when teams get stuck
- More dynamic but requires skilled facilitators

### **Option C: Progressive Revelation**
- Start with basic guides, unlock additional hints over time
- Teams can "spend" hint tokens when stuck
- Gamification element

### **Option D: Hybrid Approach**
- Base action guides for all teams
- Additional hint cards facilitators can distribute
- Digital integration for real-time updates

---

## Recommended Approach

**Primary:** Physical laminated action guide cards (easy to implement, workshop-tested format)

**Enhancement:** Facilitator coaching cards with additional hints for teams that get stuck

**Future:** Digital integration once workshop format is proven

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create action guides for each team/phase combination**
2. **Test with focus groups of mixed technical/non-technical participants**
3. **Refine based on feedback**
4. **Create facilitator training on when/how to provide additional guidance**
5. **Develop escalation procedures for teams that remain stuck**

This approach provides **scaffolding without spoilers** - enough structure to keep teams productive while preserving the challenge and learning experience.
