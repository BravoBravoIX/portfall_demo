## Facilitator Questions Guide
### How to Use Team Question Documents

## OVERVIEW

This folder contains structured question documents for facilitators to guide and assess each team during the 75-minute Southgate Terminal cybersecurity exercise. Each document is designed to:

- Prompt teams at critical decision points
- Assess team performance against objectives
- Capture observations for debriefing
- Maintain exercise momentum

---

## DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

Each team has a dedicated question document:

1. **EXECUTIVE_TEAM_QUESTIONS.md** - Strategic leadership assessment
2. **LEGAL_TEAM_QUESTIONS.md** - Compliance and risk management
3. **MEDIA_TEAM_QUESTIONS.md** - Crisis communications
4. **TECHNICAL_TEAM_QUESTIONS.md** - Investigation and response
5. **OPERATIONS_TEAM_QUESTIONS.md** - Safety and continuity
6. **INCIDENT_COORDINATOR_QUESTIONS.md** - Multi-team coordination

## TIMING FLEXIBILITY

Each document offers three timing options:

### Option A: Continuous Assessment (Every 10 Minutes)
- Maximum insight into team thinking
- Early identification of issues
- Higher facilitator workload
- Best for training exercises

### Option B: Phase-Based (T+30, T+60, T+90)
- Natural break points
- Phase transition assessment
- Balanced workload
- Best for formal assessments

### Option C: Event-Driven
- Questions at critical moments
- Responsive to exercise flow
- Requires facilitator judgment
- Best for experienced teams
